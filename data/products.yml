    The UHPC comprises over 60 pilots who fly sites throughout the province. We have a mixture of inland and coastal sites which cater for every wind direction and are no more than 90 minutes' drive from most areas of the province. We are a well-established club (formerly as the Ulster Hang Gliding Club, active since 1975) and have some excellent sites. Our XC (Cross Country) records are steadily improving (Paragliding 104 km: From White Mountain, overflying the Mourne Mountains, to Kilkeel by M.McBride/Hang gliding 89 km: From Slieve Gallion to Knocknacran south of Dundalk by M Knight) as knowledge and equipment improves year on year. Our friends in the Irish Hang Gliding & Paragliding Association (IHPA) have been similarly improving their flying performances (Paragliding 212 km/Hang gliding 129 km). You can check out the IHPA website for further information regarding flying sites in the Republic of Ireland. We are keen to share our sport with anyone interested, so contact us and come along and see what foot-launched gliding is like for yourself. We will be more than happy to show you the latest equipment and talk to you about the variety of ways to safely achieve your pilot ratings. You may even be able to try it first hand with a dual flight with some of our most experienced pilots.
