    The Ulster Hang Gliding and Paragliding Club (UHPC) is the only hang gliding and paragliding club in Northern Ireland and is affiliated with the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association (BHPA). We are recognised by SportNI as the governing body for hang gliding and paragliding in Northern Ireland. In addition, we welcome paramotorists and powered hang glider pilots, whose flying activities closely align with non-powered equivalents.
